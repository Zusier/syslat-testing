# syslat-testing

This is a repository for tests I've conducted with SysLat and a tool to visualize SysLat log files, LatViz.

LatViz Usage is simple:
```latviz.exe <path to syslat log.json>```
After running, you should receive an .svg scatter plot of the log, the average, %1 low and maximum latency data points.
