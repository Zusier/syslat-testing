# syslat-testing

This is a repository for tests I've conducted with SysLat and a tool to visualize SysLat log files, vizlat.

vizlat Usage is simple:
```vizlat.exe <path to syslat log.json>```
After running, you should receive an .svg scatter plot of the log, the average, 1% low and maximum latency data points.

## To Test
Feel free to request, I  may or may not get to it. Been really busy.
